# licneseplaterecognition
Real time license plate number detection for image, webcam, video.

Project Overview

This includes; Project Goals, Description, Competitive Analysis, Team Resources, Procedures, Schedule, Current Status, outcomes. Moreover, ultimate goal of this project is to detect license plate number of vehicles for industry purpose and classify vehicles entering in company according to their category in essence; employees, visitors, co-workers.  

Proposed Model 

To achieve this goal, we developed different models as follows for same objective.
1.	Yolov4 function model CPU
2.	Tensorflow GPU 
3.	Tesseract 
4.	Easyocr

Requirements

 In all models we need to install various dependencies and setups using command prompt/ git bash. 
1.	Yolov4 function model CPU
In order to run yolov4 we need install conda.cpu.yml in conda. Prior to yml setup we have to activate conda-cpu environment.

2.	Tensorflow GPU 
For tensorflow GPU setup we have clone GPU model from official git on your system. Furthermore, for GPU setup requires following prerequisites python 3.7-3.9, Cuda & Cudnn 10.1, Visual Studio C++ build tools, Protoc. 
     
3.	Tesseract 
Tesseract exe application setup 
pytesseract 0.3.7

4.	Easyocr  
easy-ocr 0.1.1
imutils 0.5.4
haarcascade xml
